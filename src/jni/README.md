`libParticleOmxHiFiComponent.so` from iBasso DX80 and DX90 firmware is linked against `libOpenSLES.so`, though MangoPlayer does not utilize this functionality. As a result, when MangoPlayer starts, `libOpenSLES.so` is loaded into RAM, along with its dependencies, some megabytes in total.

This stub resolves `libParticleOmxHiFiComponent.so` required externals, but does nothing, allowing to make the whole MangoPlayer lighter, and to remove a lot of redundant files from the firmware.

The original source code was taken from the [Android master branch](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/wilhelm/) at February 08, 2016, then it was edited to the minimum required for building the stub.

Also, `liblog.so` stub contains all the required externals, but does nothing, apart from returning reasonable values. This effectively stops system logging for any process. The original source code was taken from the [Android master branch](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/liblog/) at March 13, 2016.

If you need this piece of work for a reason, please don't forget to mention the place you've taken it from (this one!).
