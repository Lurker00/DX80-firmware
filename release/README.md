#iBasso DX80 firmware modified by Lurker

**DISCLAIMER:** No changes were made to the basic player functionality and behavior! Expect the same bugs and misbehavior found in the base stock firmware! **No warranty at all: use the modified firmware at your own risk and responsibility!**

**NOTE:** to tell which version is running, go to _Settings_->_Advanced_->_System Info_ and check the _Model number_. The modification version number (L0, L1 etc) is right after the actual model number (DX80).

Firmware images (`update.img`) are compressed with [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) for it produces significantly smaller archives compared to ZIP.

- [`DX80FirmwareV1.3.0-L1.7z`](https://github.com/Lurker00/DX80-firmware/raw/master/release/DX80FirmwareV1.3.0-L1.7z) - same as L0, but with default fonts.
- [`DX80FirmwareV1.3.0-L0.7z`](https://github.com/Lurker00/DX80-firmware/raw/master/release/DX80FirmwareV1.3.0-L0.7z) - fonts replaced ([1]), unused services disabled ([2]), CPU at performance mode ([3]), unregistered video codecs ([4]), custom built NTFS drivers ([5]).

#Detailed description of the changes

##Introduction for those who seeks the sound quality
All firmware versions for iBasso DX80, stock or with my modifications, are bit perfect. It means, with EQ turned off, the *sound data is not affected by the software, and is transferred to the DAC exactly as it is*. Any difference in sound signatures between versions are resulted from different conditions under which the hardware is running.

In DAPs, with limited space and one battery as the power source for both digital and analog circuits, the sound signature also depends on CPU load. So, any changes in the firmware code, even unrelated directly to the sound path, may affect the sound signature.

##1. Fonts replaced

iBasso uses `Microsoft YaHei` for Latin-based and Chinese characters, and `Nimbus Sans Global Bold` for the rest (Cyrillic, Japanese, Korean, Thai etc). It also uses pre-calculated character width tables, which (confirmed by calculations!) do not correspond to any, or any combination, of those fonts. Regardless of the reason iBasso went this way, the resulting texts look awful for me, and it was the primary reason for the firmware modification.

The two fonts used by iBasso are replaced with one, which is `Roboto Condensed`, with the missing characters merged from `Arial Unicode MS`. Character width tables were calculated from the actual font metrics.

##2. Unused services disabled

The full list is:
* `akmd` (driver for AK8975, 3-axis electronic compass IC, which is not present in DX80).
* `debuggerd` (gdb debugger interface, also creates crash logs of native applications).
* `drmserver` (Digital Rights Management service).
* `installd` (required to install Android applications from APK).
* `keystore` (manages cryptographic keys).
* `lmkd` (Low Memory Killer service).
* `mediaserver` (indexes media files, provides access to them for Android applications).
* `netd` (internet servers and services).
* `rild` (controls wireless hardware).
* `servicemanager` (Android applications interface to hardware and resources).
* `surfaceflinger` (provides screen access for Android applications).

It is obvious that none of them have any use in DX80.

**Note:** At the startup, you may see two small logos instead of one big on the screen. It's OK, don't worry! The stock firmware displays two similar pictures with almost a second delay in between, when with this modification there is no a delay, which causes distorted screen view.

##3. CPU is always working at the highest performance

By default, Android uses `interactive` CPU performance governor, meaning, CPU frequency depends on a load and may be changed. Changes in the CPU working frequency during audio playback affect the stability of the power source and temperature, probably, also the stability of the sound stream from CPU to DAC. So, stable CPU speed also means stable power and temperature of other components: DAC, clock generator, op-amps. This firmware forces `performance` governor, i.e. always highest supported frequency.

Keep CPU running at the highest speed (1.2GHz for DX80) does not mean to drain more power: Linux/Android kernel is smart enough to halt a CPU core if it is not actually used. Also, CPU is not the main power consumer: display, flash, RAM, DAC and analog part (including headphone amplifier) in total consume much more.

##4. Unregistered video codecs

The codec set used by Mango player includes video playback related stuff. The tweak is to remove video codecs from declarations. It slightly optimizes the way the player works.

##5. Custom built NTFS drivers
Recently I've finished [my port of exFAT and NTFS drivers for Android](https://github.com/Lurker00/Android-fs) and decided to use them in DX80 firmware. They are built from the latest original source code (DX80 uses old versions), and I've made some changes which I found useful for DX80: in particular, NTFS driver does not update "last access" timestamp. It means, there are no writes to the SD card or HDD each time a track is played or a cover is displayed.

**Note:** exFAT driver in DX80 is implemented at the kernel level, and currently I see no a way to replace it with mine. Good news that it does not update "last access" timestamp, so, no reasons to worry about.
